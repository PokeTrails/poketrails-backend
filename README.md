## Libaries Used

### Front-end

- **`react` (v18.3.1)**: The core library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI components, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

- **`react-dom` (v18.3.1)**: Provides DOM-specific methods that are used by React to render components into the DOM. This is essential for managing updates to the UI.

- **`react-router-dom` (v6.25.1)**: Facilitates routing and navigation in the application. It allows the creation of a dynamic, single-page application with client-side routing capabilities.

### Styling and UI

- **`@mui/material` (v5.16.4)**: A popular React UI framework that provides a comprehensive set of components and styles based on Material Design principles. This library is used for building a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- **`@mui/icons-material` (v5.16.4)**: Includes a set of Material Design icons that can be used in the application to enhance the visual representation and user interaction.

- **`@emotion/react` (v11.13.0) and `@emotion/styled` (v11.13.0)**: Used for writing CSS styles with JavaScript. Emotion provides a flexible and efficient way to style components in React, with support for dynamic styling and theming.

- **`@fontsource/roboto` (v5.0.13) and `@fontsource/saira` (v5.0.28)**: Custom font loading library to include Roboto and Saira fonts in the application, ensuring a consistent and modern typography. Roboto is used as a backup font, Saira is used as the main font in the application.

### Development and Build Tools

- **`vite` (v5.3.4)**: A fast and modern build tool that provides an optimized development experience with features such as hot module replacement (HMR) and efficient bundling.

- **`@vitejs/plugin-react` (v4.3.1)**: A Vite plugin that provides React-specific features such as fast refresh and automatic JSX transformation, optimizing the development workflow.

### State Management and Data Handling

- **`axios` (v1.7.2)**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests. It simplifies data fetching and error handling, making it easier to interact with backend services.

- **`dotenv` (v16.4.5)**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, allowing for configuration and secrets management outside of the codebase.

### Testing

- **`cypress` (v13.13.2)**: An end-to-end testing framework that provides a reliable way to write and run tests for the application's UI, ensuring that user interactions and workflows function as expected.

- **`mocha` (v10.7.3)**: A test framework for writing unit and integration tests. Mocha provides a flexible and extensible testing environment.

- **`mochawesome` (v7.1.3) and `mochawesome-merge` (v4.3.0)**: Reporters for Mocha that generate detailed and visually appealing test reports, which can be used to analyze test results and coverage.

### Additional Features

- **`howler` (v2.2.4)**: A library for managing audio in the application, providing support for features like sound playback, control, and customization. Used to play Pok√©mon cry sounds.

- **`react-confetti` (v6.1.0)**: A lightweight React component for rendering confetti animations, adding visual effects to celebrate events or interactions in the application. Used in the Pok√©mon hatching pop up to add a bit more style and interaction for the user.

### Back-end

- **bcryptjs**: Used for securing user passwords by hashing them before storing them in the database. It also provides a method to verify hashed passwords against plain text inputs, enhancing application security by ensuring safe user authentication.

- **cors**: Manages and controls access to resources from different domains. It allows or restricts requests from external origins, ensuring that only authorized domains can interact with the API, thus preventing unauthorized access while enabling legitimate cross-origin requests.

- **dotenv**: Facilitates secure management of environment variables by loading configurations from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This keeps sensitive information like API keys and database credentials out of the source code, improving security and making it easier to manage different environments (development, testing, production).

- **express**: A web framework used to build server-side logic and manage HTTP requests and responses. It provides robust features for routing, middleware support, and integration with various templating engines, simplifying the definition of routes and processing of requests.

- **jsonwebtoken**: Manages user authentication by generating a token that encodes user information (e.g., user ID) using a secret key. This token is sent to the client and used for authenticating subsequent requests, ensuring secure access by verifying the token's authenticity.

- **mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for interacting with MongoDB. It offers a schema-based solution to model application data, allowing easy creation, reading, updating, and deletion of database records. Mongoose also provides data validation, middleware support, and complex querying capabilities.

- **nodemon**: A development tool that automatically monitors project files for changes and restarts the server when code changes are detected. This ensures that the application reflects the latest updates without needing manual server restarts.

- **jest**: A testing framework designed to ensure code reliability and correctness. It offers a suite of utilities for writing unit and integration tests, verifying that the application functions as expected.

- **supertest**: An HTTP assertion library used for testing API endpoints. It simulates HTTP requests to Express routes, allowing verification of the API's behavior in different scenarios and ensuring that endpoints operate correctly.

## Testing

### Front-end Testing

Front-end testing was conducted in several layers, including local development testing, public development testing, production user testing and automated Cypress testing to ensure that the application worked as we intended it to without any errors.

Front-end features were scoped and planned to be completed by a specific due date, and so during development of each feature, each function, component and page was developed locally and tested on a local instance. This would then be pushed up to a development branch to test using the public database to ensure it would work not only in a production setting, but to also test it working on different devices to ensure it is accessible on a range of screen sizes such as on tablets and phones. 

A spreadsheet of the results from user testing can be found in the Github repository, detailing development and user testing for the login-sign-up workflows. Further notes can also be found in a screenshot in the same directory.

A report of the automated testing from Cypress can be found in the Output.html file.

For ease of access, screenshots of the testing and results can be viewed below:
